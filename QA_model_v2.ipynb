It's important to keep the soil evenly damp and allow it to dry between waterings, especially as you approach harvest time.\n",

      "- **Turnips**: Quick to harvest in 30-60 days, they thrive in rich, well-drained soil and are pest-resistant.\n",
      "- **Butterhead Lettuce**: Grows well in moist, sandy loam and is ready to harvest in about 60 days.\n",
      "- **Husk Tomatoes and Ground Cherries**: These warm-season plants are hardy and can tolerate inconsistent temperatures.\n",

If you're in a cooler climate, consider overwintering them indoors once they become semi-dormant. Would you like more information on growing conditions or care tips?\n",
