=== Fruits ===

One of the most essential tips for growing fruits successfully is selecting varieties suited to your specific climate. Growing the wrong fruit for your region leads to poor yields, disease issues, and plant stress. Understanding your local environment and making informed decisions ensures healthy, productive plants.
Start by identifying your USDA Hardiness Zone, which indicates the average minimum winter temperatures in your area. This zone helps determine which fruits can survive and thrive in your region. For example:
Zone 3–5: Best for cold-hardy fruits like apples, cherries, and currants.
Zone 6–8: Suitable for peaches, plums, and certain grape varieties.
Zone 9–11: Ideal for citrus, figs, avocados, and bananas.

== USDA Zone and Suitable Fruits ==
Zone 3 Apples, currants, gooseberries, hardy plums
Zone 4 Apples, cherries, raspberries, cold-hardy grapes
Zone 5 Pears, apricots, plums, blueberries
Zone 6 Peaches, nectarines, grapes, blackberries
Zone 7 Figs, persimmons, pomegranates, late peaches
Zone 8 Citrus (with protection), olives, almonds
Zone 9 Oranges, lemons, avocados, guavas
Zone 10	Bananas, mangoes, papayas, lychees
Zone 11	Tropical fruits year-round: pineapples, coconuts, breadfruit

Knowing your USDA Zone is one of the core tips for growing fruits, ensuring you select varieties that can survive and produce reliably in your climate.

== Match Fruit Varieties to Local Conditions ==
Beyond hardiness, consider other local climate factors such as:

Chill hours: Some fruits like apples and peaches require a specific number of chill hours (hours below 45°F) to produce fruit.

Humidity: High humidity areas may struggle with fungal diseases on sensitive fruit trees.
Rainfall patterns: Drought-tolerant varieties are better suited for arid climates, while water-loving fruits like blueberries prefer consistent moisture.

Examples of Climate-Appropriate Fruits
Cold climates: Apples, pears, plums, gooseberries
Temperate climates: Grapes, peaches, nectarines, blackberries
Tropical/subtropical climates: Mangoes, citrus, guavas, papayas
Tailoring your choices to the environment is one of the most reliable tips for growing fruits that yield high-quality harvests year after year.

Soil Preparation and Fertility
Another critical aspect of successful fruit cultivation is soil quality. Among the top tips for growing fruits is ensuring your soil is fertile, well-drained, and properly structured to support root development and nutrient uptake.

Test Soil pH and Nutrient Levels
Start by conducting a soil test using a home kit or through your local cooperative extension service. Most fruit plants prefer slightly acidic to neutral soil:

Ideal pH range: 6.0 to 7.0 for most fruits

Blueberries require more acidic soil: 4.5 to 5.5

A soil test reveals pH, nutrient levels (N-P-K), and any deficiencies in micronutrients like iron, magnesium, or calcium—each essential for optimal plant health.

Add Organic Amendments
Based on your soil test results, amend the soil with organic matter to boost fertility and structure. Recommended organic amendments include:
Compost: Improves soil biology and provides slow-release nutrients

Well-rotted manure: High in nitrogen and beneficial microbes

Bone meal and rock phosphate: Great for phosphorus, which supports flowering and fruiting

Greensand or kelp meal: Provides potassium and trace minerals

Ensure Good Drainage and Soil Structure
Proper drainage is essential. Fruit roots will rot in waterlogged soils. Tips for growing fruits in poorly drained areas include:
Creating raised beds or mounds

Incorporating coarse sand or perlite

Avoiding heavy clay soils without amendment

Good soil structure—crumbly and rich in organic matter—promotes aeration, root expansion, and microbial activity. Before planting, work the soil at least 12–18 inches deep to break up compaction and integrate amendments.

Following these foundational tips for growing fruits gives your plants the environment they need to establish strong roots and support productive growth.

Proper Planting Techniques
Planting fruit trees and bushes correctly is foundational to long-term success. Poor planting practices lead to weak establishment and lower yields. Among the key tips for growing fruits, mastering proper planting techniques is non-negotiable.

Correct planting time is a crucial part of effective tips for growing fruits, ensuring proper establishment and maximizing early growth and fruiting success.

Correct Depth and Spacing
Depth: Dig a hole twice as wide as the root ball and just deep enough so the plant sits at the same level it did in the nursery. For grafted trees, keep the graft union at least 2 inches above the soil line.

Spacing: Follow spacing guidelines for each species to allow airflow and root expansion. Common recommendations:
Apples and pears: 15–20 ft

Peaches and plums: 12–18 ft

Berries: 2–5 ft between plants

Proper spacing reduces disease pressure and improves fruit quality through better light penetration.

Grafted vs. Seed-Grown Plants
Grafted plants are preferred for most fruit trees. They offer:

Faster maturity and fruit production

Known fruit characteristics

Disease-resistant rootstocks

Seed-grown plants take longer to bear fruit and may not produce true-to-type fruit. They are usually only suitable for certain species like papaya or some citrus.
One of the most important tips for growing fruits is setting the plant up correctly from day one. A properly planted and spaced tree or bush will have a healthier start, need fewer interventions, and yield more reliably over its life.

Watering and Mulching Strategies
Effective water management and mulching are essential tips for growing fruits that thrive. Watering too little or too much can severely impact fruit production and plant health, while proper mulching conserves moisture and suppresses weeds.

Best Irrigation Practices
Young plants: Require regular, deep watering during the first 1–2 years to establish strong root systems. Water 1–2 times per week depending on rainfall and soil type.

Mature plants: Need consistent moisture during the growing and fruiting seasons. Deep watering every 7–10 days is generally sufficient.

Avoid overhead watering: Use drip irrigation or soaker hoses to reduce leaf wetness and disease risk.

Always water early in the morning to allow foliage to dry during the day.
Importance of Consistent Moisture

One of the most overlooked tips for growing fruits is maintaining even soil moisture, especially during flowering and fruit set. Inconsistent watering can lead to:

Blossom end rot (especially in tomatoes and peppers)

Fruit cracking

Premature fruit drop

Reduced sugar content

Monitor soil moisture regularly using a soil probe or by checking 2–4 inches below the surface.

Use of Mulches
Applying mulch is a high-impact practice for all fruit-growing systems. Benefits include:

Moisture retention: Reduces evaporation and watering needs

Weed suppression: Limits competition for nutrients and water

Temperature moderation: Keeps root zones cooler in summer and warmer in winter

Recommended mulch types:

Organic: Straw, wood chips, bark, shredded leaves, compost

Depth: Apply 2–4 inches, keeping mulch a few inches away from plant stems or trunks to prevent rot

Combining proper watering techniques with strategic mulching ranks among the top tips for growing fruits that are healthy, productive, and low-maintenance.

Pest and Disease Management
One of the most important tips for growing fruits successfully is controlling pests and diseases before they cause significant damage. Preventative strategies and timely interventions keep your fruit trees and bushes healthy and productive.

Identify Common Fruit Pests
Different fruits attract different pests, but some of the most common include:

Codling moth (apples, pears): Larvae burrow into fruit

Aphids (many fruit trees): Suck sap, distort leaves, and spread viruses

Spider mites (grapes, citrus): Cause stippling and leaf drop

Fruit flies (stone fruits, citrus): Lay eggs inside ripening fruit

Scale insects (citrus, figs): Attach to bark and sap nutrients

Regular inspection of leaves, stems, and fruit is essential for early detection.

Disease Threats to Watch
Fungal, bacterial, and viral diseases can devastate crops if not managed:

Powdery mildew (grapes, apples): White fungal coating on leaves and fruit

Fire blight (pears, apples): Causes blackened, wilted shoots

Brown rot (stone fruits): Leads to fruit rot and mummification
Citrus canker: Bacterial disease that causes leaf and fruit lesions

Proper pruning, sanitation, and resistant varieties are key to prevention.

Integrated Pest Management (IPM)
A top-tier strategy among tips for growing fruits is using Integrated Pest Management (IPM), which combines biological, cultural, physical, and chemical tools:
Biological: Release or encourage beneficial insects like ladybugs and lacewings

Cultural: Rotate crops, clean up fallen fruit, use disease-resistant varieties

Physical: Use barriers like fruit bags or nets

Chemical: Use targeted, minimal pesticides only when thresholds are reached
Organic and Low-Impact Solutions
Neem oil, insecticidal soap, and horticultural oils can control many soft-bodied insects

Copper fungicide or sulfur sprays can manage fungal diseases

Sticky traps and pheromone lures aid in monitoring and trapping pests

One of the most practical tips for growing fruits is staying ahead of pest and disease issues with routine checks and preventative measures, rather than relying solely on treatments after damage occurs.

Pruning and Maintenance
Regular pruning and general maintenance are critical tips for growing fruits that produce high yields and remain healthy over time. Without proper upkeep, fruit trees can become overgrown, unproductive, and more susceptible to pests and disease.

Why Pruning Is Essential
Pruning serves several important functions:

Promotes better air circulation and sunlight penetration

Encourages new, productive growth

Removes dead, diseased, or damaged wood

Shapes the plant for structural strength and ease of harvest

Neglecting to prune can lead to dense canopies, smaller fruits, and increased disease pressure.

Seasonal Pruning Guidelines
Winter (dormant season): Ideal for major structural pruning of most deciduous fruit trees. It stimulates strong new growth in spring.

Summer: Best for thinning out excess growth, managing size, and removing water sprouts or suckers.

Spring and fall: Avoid heavy pruning during these times, as it can expose the plant to disease or reduce cold hardiness.

Timing varies slightly by fruit type:

Apples, pears: Prune in late winter

Peaches, plums: Prune in early spring

Grapes: Prune when fully dormant

Basic Pruning Tips for Growing Fruits
Use sharp, clean tools to make clean cuts

Remove any crossing or rubbing branches

Thin out crowded areas to maintain an open canopy

Maintain a central leader or open-center form depending on species

Routine Maintenance Tasks
Aside from pruning, key maintenance activities include:

Staking and support for young or top-heavy plants

Removing suckers from the base of trees or rootstock

Cleaning up fallen fruit to prevent pest infestations

Monitoring and adjusting mulch and irrigation

Consistent, correct pruning and maintenance are among the most impactful long-term tips for growing fruits that remain vigorous, manageable, and reliably productive.

Harvesting and Storage
Timing your harvest correctly and handling fruit with care are essential tips for growing fruits that taste great and last longer. Proper techniques minimize waste, maintain quality, and ensure the full benefits of your labor.

Recognize Peak Ripeness
Each fruit has specific signs of maturity. Harvesting too early reduces flavor and sugar content, while late harvesting can lead to spoilage or pest damage.

Common indicators:

Apples: Ease of separation from branch, background skin color change

Peaches and plums: Slight softness near stem, full coloration, sweet aroma

Berries: Uniform color and easy removal without tugging

Citrus: Full color and slight give when squeezed, though some citrus continues to sweeten after picking

Always taste-test a sample before beginning a large harvest.

Harvesting Techniques
Use pruning shears or clippers for tougher stems (grapes, citrus, apples)

For softer fruits (peaches, berries), gently twist or lift the fruit to avoid bruising

Harvest in the morning when fruits are cool and hydrated, but after dew has dried to reduce disease spread

Use shallow containers to avoid crushing and stacking damage

Proper harvesting is one of the most practical tips for growing fruits with maximum shelf life and market quality.

Post-Harvest Storage Tips
Refrigerate berries, grapes, apples, and stone fruits for best longevity

Cure fruits like pears at room temperature before refrigerating

Do not wash fruits before storage unless absolutely necessary

Store different fruits separately, as some (like apples) emit ethylene gas that speeds up ripening in others

Recommended Storage Durations for Common Fruits:
Fruits:
Apples	Storage Method Refrigerated (32–40°F),	Recommended Duration 1–3 months
Pears	Storage Method Ripen at room temp, Recommended Duration then refrigerate 2–4 weeks after ripening
Peaches	Storage Method Refrigerated,	Recommended Duration 5–7 days
Plums	Storage Method Refrigerated,	Recommended Duration 7–10 days
Berries	Storage Method Refrigerated, Recommended Duration (unwashed) 2–7 days
Grapes	Storage Method Refrigerated,	Recommended Duration 1–2 weeks
Citrus (oranges, lemons, etc.)	Storage Method Refrigerated,	Recommended Duration 2–4 weeks
Figs	Storage Method Refrigerated,	Recommended Duration 2–3 days
Cherries	Storage Method Refrigerated,	Recommended Duration 4–7 days
Bananas	Storage Method Room temperature,	Recommended Duration 2–5 days (longer when underripe)
Mangoes	Storage Method Ripen at room temp, Recommended Duration then refrigerate 5–7 days after ripening
Proper handling and storage are key tips for growing fruits that maintain flavor and shelf life after harvest.

Understanding when and how to harvest, combined with proper storage methods, rounds out essential tips for growing fruits that not only grow well but also deliver the best possible eating quality.

== Amaranth ==

Growing Amaranth
Amaranth is a warm-season, leafy green vegetable similar in both taste and appearance to garden spinach.
It was originally native only to Central America. From its origin, it was cultivated and traded in prehistorical times throughout southern North America and northern South America by indigenous peoples. It now also is cultivated in Africa, Europe, and Asia.
It grows best in warm, humid, near-tropical climates, and thrives in regions where other leafy greens including spinach may be subject to early bolting. It is rarely cultivated in the continental United States or Canada.

Amaranth Plant and Care Guide
Yield:
Allow 4–6 plants per household member.
Planting:
Seed germinates in 10–12 days. Sow seed in full sun in spring for summer harvest when soil warms to 60–80°F (16–27°C). Sow seed 1/4-in. (6-mm) deep, 8–12 in. (20–30 cm) apart, thinning to 4–6 in. (10–15 cm) apart, in rows 8–12 in. (20–30 cm) apart. Transplant seedlings when 3–3-1/2 in. (75–90 mm) tall, spaced 4–6 in. (10–15 cm) apart, in rows 8–12 in. (20–30 cm) apart.
Conditions:
Growing temperature: 72–86°F (22–30°C). Best in warm climates with high humidity, a greenhouse, or other protected site. Protect plants from temperatures below 60°F (16°C).
Soil:
Moist, well-drained soil. Fertility: Rich. 5.5–7.0 pH. Prepare soil at least 2 ft. (60 cm) deep.
Care:
Challenging. Keep evenly moist; avoid wetting foliage. Fertilize semi-weekly with 10–10–10 formula or organic liquid fertilizer. Mulch. Cultivate. Pinch plants back when 7–8 in. (18–20 cm) tall for greater production.
Companions:
Compact, leafy green vegetables, radishes, and strawberries.
Harvest:
42–70 days. Thin outer leaves when plant is 6–8 in. (15–20 cm) tall, then pick greens again when 4–5 new leaves emerge for continuous harvest of tender, edible leaves.
Storage Tips:
Store fresh in vegetable keeper of refrigerator for 1–2 weeks. Leaves are primarily used raw in salads or steamed for use as a cooked vegetable similar to spinach.

== Artichoke, French Artichoke, or Globe Artichoke. ==

Growing Artichokes
Artichokes are cool-season perennial vegetables. An edible, thistle-like relative of cardoon, artichokes are tasty and prolific.
Artichokes require abundant space—mature plants are 6 ft. (1.8 m) wide and 3–4 ft. (90–120 cm) high—so consider garden placement with eventual size in mind.

Artichoke Plant and Care Guide
Yield:
Allow 1 plant per 1–2 household members. For preserving, allow 2–4 plants, yielding 4 qts. (3.8 l) of artichoke hearts.
Planting:
Seed germinates in 14-21 days; also available in spring as root divisions. Sow seed indoors in late winter–early spring 2 weeks before last expected frost. Transplant seedlings and set out root divisions in full-sun locations when soil warms to 50–85°F (10–29°C). Sow seed 1/2-in. (12-mm) deep and 6 in. (15 cm) apart, thinning to 6–8 ft. (1.8–2.4 m) apart, in rows 6–8 ft. (1.8–2.4 m) apart.
Conditions:
Growing Temperature: 40–75°F (4–24°C). Zones 4–7:  Grow as annual. Zones 8–10:  Grow as perennial. Shade plants in full sunlight at temperatures over 95°F (35°C). Prefers mild winters and cool summers with constant temperatures and frequent precipitation. Layered with heavy mulch, they sometimes survive temperatures to 0°F (–18°C). In short-season, cold-winter climates, plant artichoke in large, movable containers for relocation indoors before first frost.
Soil:
Damp, well-drained, sandy soil. Fertility: Rich. 6.0–6.8 pH. Prepare soil at least 3 ft. (90 cm) deep.
Care:
Moderate. Keep evenly damp; allow soil surface to dry between waterings. Water deeply. Fertilize in spring and autumn with 5–10–10 formula. Mulch. Cut stalks and leaves to the soil after harvest, forcing new growth. Replace plants every 3–4 years. Aphid, earwig and powdery mildew susceptible.
Companions:
Asparagus, rhubarb.
Harvest:
Plants produce progressive crops of artichokes over a 2-4 month period in spring and early summer. Cut immature buds when 3–4 in. (75–100 mm) wide before scales loosen or flowers form, in spring of second season and annually thereafter for steaming; to 3 in. (75 mm) wide for preserved hearts. Fan scales and clean thoroughly under abundant running water, clipping off thorns and outer leaves with scissors.
Storage Tips:
Store fresh in vegetable keeper of refrigerator for 5–7 days; cooked and frozen, 2–3 months; pickled or canned, 1–2 years. Steam or boil until tender (about 20 minutes). Serve hot or cold, with butter or salad dressing; the soft part of the outer leaves, entire heart, and stem are edible. Buds allowed to go to seed produce attractive purple thistlelike flowers for cutting or drying.

== Asparagus ==

Growing Asparagus
Asparagus is a cool-season perennial. This member of the lily family is a prized, early-spring delicacy. Plants grown from seed require 3 years to become established and will produce spears but yield ample harvests annually for 20 or more years. The edible green female spears are capped with a bud-forming top; allowed to go to seed, the buds will sprout feathery, fernlike foliage.

Asparagus Plant and Care Guide
Yield:
Allow 10–15 plants per household member.
Planting:
Plant either seed or transplant root crowns.
Indoor Starts. Seed germinates in 14–21 days. Sow seed indoors in flats 12–14 weeks before last expected frost, grow to 3–4 in. (7.5–10 cm) tall and harden seedlings 7–10 days before transplanting. Transplant seedlings outdoors when soil warms to 50–85°F (10–29°C).
Direct Sowing. Sow seed in garden soil after soil warms to 50–85°F (10–29°C). Sow seed 1-1/2-in. (38-mm) deep, 2 in. (50 mm) apart, thinning to 6 in. (15 cm) apart, in rows 2 ft. (60 cm) apart.
Transplants. Alternatively, plant root crowns in late winter or early spring for annual harvests beginning in the second season. Plant crowns 18 in. (45 cm) apart, in trenches 1 ft. (30 cm) deep, backfilled with organic compost until 8 in. (20 cm) deep. Bury crowns with a layer of soil 2 in. (50 mm) deep, adding more soil over the plants in spring as their spears emerge, gradually filling the trench.
Conditions:
Growing temperature: 60–85°F (16–29°C). Zones 3–10. Shade plants in full sunlight at temperatures over 95°F (35°C) to prevent bolting.
Soil:
Moist, well-drained soil. Fertility: Rich. 6.0–6.8 pH. Prepare soil at least 1 ft. (30 cm) deep.
Care:
Challenging. Keep evenly moist. Apply ample water during the so-called “fern stage.” Fertilize in early spring and after harvest with 10–5–5 formula supplemented with garden lime. Mulch. Cultivate.
Cut back feathery foliage to 1 in. (25 mm) above soil when it turns brown. Mulch heavily in cold-winter climates to protect root crowns from freezing and frost heaving.
To grow white spears, blanch asparagus by covering the bed with black plastic supported at least 12 in. (30 cm) high on stakes before spears emerge.
Rodent susceptible. Insect pest and disease resistant.
Companions:
Artichokes, basil, parsley, and tomatoes.
Harvest:
Spring of third season, then annually. Avoid harvesting asparagus spears during first two seasons until root crowns are established and have multiplied.
Thereafter, harvest each season in spring. Plants produces thin male and stout female shoots for 4–6 weeks in spring. Cut only female spears when they are  1–4‑1/2‑in. (2.5–11.4‑cm) in diameter and up to 10 in. (25 cm) tall.
Storage Tips:
Fresh in vegetable keeper of refrigerator for 2–3 weeks; blanched and frozen, 4–6 months; pickled or canned, 1–2 years.
Steam or grill until tender. Avoid using metal utensils that discolors asparagus. Avoid salting water used for cooking to retain asparagus’ bright green color; cook, then chill in an ice-water bath.

== Beans, Broad; Fava; Horse; or Windsor ==

Growing Broad Beans
Broad beans are a cool-season annual and member of the vetch family. They produce large pods on plants to 4-1/2-ft. (1.4 m) tall, bearing somewhat flat, oval-shaped beans in a variety of colors, including green, pinkish red, white, and yellow. Broad beans may be harvested green for immediate use or for canning; They may also be picked and dried for long-term storage and later use.
Exercise caution: Sample only a small portion of broad beans at first exposure before eating large quantities of broad beans. A few people in the population suffer from an enzyme deficiency disorder called Favism with significant health risks.
Those with the rare condition may have serious allergic reactions if they ingest Fava or other broad beans. Symptoms include difficulty breathing, rapid pulse, and anemia, and require immediate medical attention.

Broad Beans Plant and Care Guide
Yield:
Allow 4–8 plants per household member.
Planting:
Seed germinates in 7–12 days.
Short-Season Climates:  Sow seed indoors 3–4 weeks before last frost and harden seedlings 7 days before transplanting when plants are 3–4 in. (75-100 mm) tall.
Average Climates:  Sow seed in garden soil in early spring through midseason, depending on cultivar, when soil warms to 50–85°F (10–29°C).
Mild-Winter Climates: Plant in autumn for late winter or early-spring harvest.
Over-Winter Gardens: Sow fava beans as seed from September–October for harvest in spring–summer of the following season.
Sow seed 1 in. (25 mm) deep, 4–5 in. (10–13 cm) apart, thinning to 6 in. (15 cm) apart, in rows 3 ft. (90 cm) apart.
Plant successions at 60-day intervals.
Conditions:
Growing temperature: 60–65°F (16–18°C). If sustained temperatures exceed 100°F (38°C) and are accompanied by low humidity, plants may fail; avoid planting in direct sunlight or sites with excessive heat.
Soil:
Moist, well-drained, sandy soil. Fertility: Rich. 6.0–6.8 pH. Prepare soil at least 1 ft. (30 cm) deep. Rotate plantings with leafy green and cole-family vegetables to avoid nitrogen depletion.
Care:
Moderate. Keep evenly moist until flowers form pods; water regularly thereafter. Fertilize monthly with 5–10–10 formula. Mulch. Cultivate. Pest and disease resistant.
Companions:
Cucumbers, potatoes, and summer savory.
Harvest:
80–100 days; early varieties 45-60 days. Pick pods when 2–3 in. (50–75 mm) long for use fresh; after mature and pods have dried on the vine, as for dried beans.
Storage Tips:
Fresh in vegetable keeper of refrigerator for 5–7 days; dried in porous, fabric bags stored in a cool, dry location, 1 year. Best eaten fresh, steamed and dressed with olive oil or butter, then garnished with chopped fresh tomato.

== Drying and Shelling Beans ==

Growing Beans to Dry
Drying and shelling beans and Southern Peas are warm-season annual legumes of the family Fabaceae. They are an excellent source of vegetable protein in a convenient, storable form easily used for cooking.
Shelling beans are identical to their dried cousins, but are shucked and eaten raw or cooked in a variety of ways similar to those used for snap and green beans and peas, instead of drying them.
Dried beans and peas also are intimately connected to a long slate of highly varied international and regional cuisines.

Dried Beans Plant and Care Guide
Yield:
Allow 4–8 plants per household member, yielding 2–3 lbs. (0.9–1.4 kg).
Planting:
Seed germinates in 7–12 days. Sow seed in garden soil in full sun in spring when soil warms to 60–85°F (16–29°C). Sow seed 1-1/2–2 in. (38–50 mm) deep, 1 in. (25 mm) apart, thinning to 4 in. (10 cm) apart, in rows 18–30 in. (45–75 cm) apart or in a circle planted around a pole.
Conditions:
Growing temperature: 60–85°F (16–29°C). Best in mild-summer climates. Prepare soil 12–16 in. (30–40 cm) deep.
Soil:
Moist, well-drained, sandy soil. Fertility: Rich. 6.0–6.8 pH. Prepare soil at least 1 ft. (30 cm) deep. Rotate legume crops throughout the garden to naturally boost soil nitrogen levels.
Care:
Easy. Keep evenly moist until flowers form pods; damp thereafter. Fertilize monthly with 5–10–10 formula or well-rotted manure. Avoid deep cultivation that could cut through the shallow, widespread roots. Powdery mildew susceptible.
Companions:
Carrots, cauliflower, cucumbers, potatoes, and summer savory.
Harvest:
65–70 days. Pick pods when they mature and begin to wither, spread them on a flat surface in a warm, protected spot, and dry thoroughly; in arid climates, allow pods to dry on vines. Fully dry pods will split open naturally to reveal the dried beans; mature pods also can be dried in a vegetable dehydrator.
Storage Tips:
Dried in porous, fabric bags stored in a cool, dry location, to 1 year; sealed in plastic bags and frozen, to 2 years. Some dried-bean cultivars picked at the green, shelling stage known as “shuckies”—especially French flageolet, French horticultural, and great northern white beans—also may be eaten steamed with butter or cooked in soups and casseroles as you would snap beans and peas.

== Beans, Garbanzo or Gram; Chickpea ==

Growing Gram Beans and Chickpeas
Garbanzo beans are a warm season annual. They grow on a fernlike bush, 2–2-1/2-ft. (60–75-cm) tall with bulging green pods containing 1–2 tan-colored, pealike seeds, and are related to true beans and peas. Although edible when green, garbanzos most often are dried for later use. Their unique flavor and texture make them popular for use whole in salads; baked with grains, they make a nutritious, protein-rich, cholesterol-free meat substitute for vegan and vegetarian diets.

Gram Beans Plant and Care Guide
Yield:
Allow 4–8 plants per household member for eating fresh; for drying, allow 10–15 plants, yielding 2 lbs. (0.9 kg).
Planting:
Seed germinates in 7–12 days. Average Climates:  Sow seed in partial shade in spring, transplant to garden soil when soil warms to 65–80°F (18–27°C) and plants reach 3–4 in. (75-100 mm) tall. Mild-Winter Climates:  Sow seed in late autumn. Sow seed in garden soil 1-1/2–2 in. (38–50 mm) deep, 3–6 in. (75–150 mm) apart, thinning to 8–12 in. (20–30 cm) apart, in rows 2 ft. (60 cm) apart.
Conditions:
Growing temperature: 60–70°F (16–21°C). Flowers may fail to set seed pods at temperatures above 90°F (32°C).
Soil:
Moist, well-drained loam. Fertility: Rich. 6.0–6.8 pH. Prepare soil at least 18 in. (45 cm) deep. Rotate legume crops throughout the garden to naturally boost soil nitrogen levels.
Care:
Easy. Keep evenly moist during flowering and pod formation; allow soil surface to dry between waterings thereafter. Fertilize semi-monthly with 5–10–10 formula. Avoid deep cultivation that could cut through the shallow, widespread roots. Pest and disease resistant.
Companions:
Celery, corn, cucumbers, potatoes, strawberries, and summer savory.
Harvest:
100 days. Pick pods when 1 in. (25 mm) long for use fresh; picked after pods have dried on the vine orwhen mature pods have withered, spread on a flat surface in a warm, protected spot, as for dried beans.
Storage Tips:
Fresh in the vegetable keeper of a refrigerator for 5–7 days; dried in porous, fabric bags stored in a cool, dry location, to 1 year; blanched, sealed in plastic bags, and frozen, to 6 months; canned using a pressure cooker, 3 years. Fresh, boiled garbanzo beans, mashed to a paste with tahini spices, lemon juice, garlic, and olive oil, provide a tasty Middle-Eastern dip known as hummus for crudités, crackers, chips, and crisps.

== Lima and Butter Beans ==

Growing Lima and Butter Beans
Lima and its close relatives among the large beans are warm-season annuals. They were originally native to the low-elevation areas of Central and South America, and are believed to have first originated in Peru.
Both bush and pole varieties bear clusters of pods containing 3–4 large, flat, oval beans, taking longer to mature than other beans. Grow pole varieties on vertical supports  in small-space garden to maximize yield from limited growing areas.
Shell and steam fresh beans, or dry them for storage and later use in cooking. Miniature or baby lima cultivars mature quickly but yield smaller beans. The pods are fibrous and discarded.
Lima and butter beans are a key ingredient with kernels of corn used to make Succotash.

Lima and Butter Beans Plant and Care Guide
Yield:
Allow 4–8 plants per household member.

Planting:
Seed germinates in 7–10 days. Average climates:  Sow seed in garden soil in spring when soil warms to 65–85°F (18–29°C). Mild-Winter Climates:  Sow seed in autumn and late winter. Bush:  Sow seed 1-1/2–2 in. (38–50 mm) deep, 3–6 in. (75–150 mm) apart, thinning to 3 in. (75 mm) apart, in rows 2–3 ft. (60–90 cm) apart. Pole:  Sow seed 1-1/2–2 in. (38–50 mm) deep, 6–10 in. (15–25 cm) apart, thinning to 6 in. (15 cm) apart, in rows 30–36 in. (75–90 cm) apart, installing stakes at time of planting. Plant successions.

Conditions:
Growing temperature: 60–70°F (16–21°C). Flowers may fail to set fruit at temperatures over 80°F (27°C); cold, wet conditions cause flowers to drop.

Soil:
Moist, well-drained, sandy soil. Fertility: Rich. 6.0–6.8 pH. Prepare soil 12–16 in. (30–40 cm) deep. Rotate bean plantings throughout the garden to enrich its soil with nitrogen.

Care:
Easy. Keep evenly moist; avoid wetting foliage to prevent fungal disease of the pods or poor setting of fruit. Apply ample water during the pollination and pod-development stages. Fertilize monthly with 5–10–10 formula or well-rotted manure. Avoid deep cultivation that could cut through the shallow, widespread roots. Powdery mildew susceptible.

Companions:
Bush:Celery, corn, cucumbers, potatoes, strawberries, and summer savory. Pole:Scarlet runner beans, corn, summer savory, and sunflowers. Succession planting sequence includes spinach, early radish, lima bean, then beets or potatoes.

Harvest:
65–80 days. Pole: 80–95 days. Pick pods when first plump for green, shelled beans; when pods are full and begin to wither for drying. Regular picking encourages production of new flowers and a sustained harvest.

Storage Tips:
Fresh in vegetable keeper of refrigerator for 1–2 weeks; blanched and frozen, 3–4 months; pickled or canned in a pressure cooker, 2–3 years; dried in porous, fabric bags stored in a cool, dry location, 1 year.
Lima beans along with corn kernels and various other vegetables, such as onion, tomatoes, okra, and sweet peppers, along with diced ham or bacon, ham hocks, or salt pork, are essential ingredients used to make the traditional New England dish, succotash.
Rehydrate dried lima beans by soaking them in hot water at least 4 hours prior to use; beans added directly to soups and stews will remain tough.

== Scarlet-Runner Beans ==

Growing Scarlet-Runner Beans
Scarlet-runner beans are closely related to snap beans, but they grow tall—up to 20 ft. (6 m)— with more leaves and vivid flowers that produce larger pods and beans picked early for use fresh or dried in the same fashion as pinto and kidney beans.
They are frequently grown as ornamentals rather than for bean production.
Scarlet-runner beans are only available as pole varieties. Each tall vine bears bright red, pea-like flowers that produce clusters of pods containing 3–4 large, flat, oval beans. They are a long-season plant, slower to mature than other bean varieties.
Grow scarlet-runner beans on vertical supports  in small-space garden to maximize yield from limited growing areas.
Pick, shell and steam fresh beans as soon as the pods begin to fill, or allow them to mature and dry for shucking and storage for later use in dried-bean recipes or chili.
The flavor of scarlet-runner beans is a bit tart, distinctly different from milder-tasing snap and drying bean varieties.

Scarlet-Runner Beans Plant and Care Guide
Yield:
Allow 3–6 plants per household member.
Planting:

== Strawberries ==

Growing Strawberries
Strawberries are cool-season perennials. Low-growing plants, to 8 in. (20 cm) tall, bear red, heart-shaped, berrylike fruit unique for having their seeds on their fruits’ exterior skins. Strawberries reproduce by extending foliage runners that start new plants, by root division, and by seed.
Everbearing, Spring-bearing—sometimes called “June-bearing” or “Summer-bearing—cultivars are available. Everbearing strawberry varieties set and ripen new berries continuously from spring to autumn, except in hot-summer climates where they go dormant for a few months before resuming production. Spring-bearing varieties ripen a single set of berries over a 3–4 week period in late spring or early summer, beginning in their second year of growth.
All strawberries are tender perennial plants, but best production occurs when the tiny plants on forming runners are rooted and held for planting until spring of the following season, discarding the old plant that produces only sparse pickings of strawberries.
Strawberries may also be grown from germinated seed, found on the exterior of their fruit. Strawberries are the only common fruit that bears its seeds on the exterior of its fruit.

== Corn: Sweet Corn, Popcorn, and Ornamental Corn ==

Growing Corn
Corn is a warm-season annual vegetable, and its species are members of the grass family, Poaceae. First noticed by European explorers to the Western Hemisphere and now a worldwide staple, corn forms tassels at its stalk tip and several ears midway up the stalk, which can reach 9 ft. (2.7 m) tall on many cultivars.
Pollen from the flowering tassel, which is carried by the wind, pollinates sticky, silky threads on each ear of corn. Each of the threads connects to an unfertilized kernel, and the ear develops as many kernels as silks that are pollinated.
Shaking the stalks while they are in tassel, or “tasseling,” produces fuller ears of corn. In small-space gardens where corn cannot be grown in a self-pollinating block of closely spaced plants, tassel your corn to pollenate every kernel of each ear grown.
Corn varieties include sweet corn, field corn, popcorn, and ornamental corn. Each is available in early, midseason, and late cultivars, bearing kernels of many different colors and sweetnesses.

Corn Plant and Care Guide
Yield:
Allow 10–15 plants per household member.
Planting:
Seed germinates in 7–10 days. Sow seed in full sun in spring when soil warms to 50–90°F (10–32°C); sow separate beds of early and late cultivars for a sustained harvest.
Sow seed 1–2 in. (25–50 mm) deep, 4–6 in. (10–15 cm) apart, thinning to 12–18 in. (30–45 cm) apart, in at least 4 rows 2–3 ft. (60–90 cm) apart, forming a square or rectangle for good pollination. Plant successions 3–4 weeks apart.
Avoid planting different cultivars nearer together than 20 ft. (6 m), or in rows perpendicular to prevailing winds, due to cross-pollination.
Conditions:
Growing temperature: 50–95°F (10–35°C). Requires at least 6 hours of sunlight daily.
Soil:
Moist, well-drained soil. Fertility: Rich. 5.8–6.8 pH. Prepare soil at least 18 in. (45 cm) deep.
Care:
Moderate. Keep evenly moist. Apply ample water during the ear silk-and-tassel-development stage.
Tassel corn by shaking ripe tassels against one another to help fertilize small plantings. 
Fertilize with 10–5–5 formula or well-rotted manure when stalks reach 12 in. (30 cm) tall; repeat when 30 in. (75 cm) tall.
Cultivate. Corn earworm susceptible.
Companions:
Beans, cucumbers, gourds, peas, potatoes, pumpkins, and squash.
Harvest:
60–100 days. Cut ears from stalk when silks turn brown and kernels yield a white milky fluid when pierced. Immerse immediately in ice water; chilling prevents sugars from turning to starches and preserves texture.
Storage Tips:
Fresh in vegetable keeper of refrigerator for 2–4 days; blanched, cut from cob, and frozen, 3–6 months. Late-season varieties have larger kernels, sweeter flavor, and more vigorous growth habits than early varieties.

== Cucumbers ==

== Garlic ==

Growing Garlic
Garlic is a cool-season bulb vegetable in the onion, or Allium, family. Garlic plants are flat-leaved. Each plant bears a bulbous head consisting of many tear-shaped cloves wrapped in a papery tunicate sheath.
The major garlic types grown in home gardens include Hardneck, Elephant, and Softneck. Hardneck garlic grow a single rosette of cloves around a woody core. Elephant Garlic (Allium ampeloprasum), with huge bulbs and a mild, sweeter flavor than true garlic, is a member of the Leek group of Allium bulbs. Softneck garlic has several layers of small cloves surrounding a soft, fibrous core.
When used raw, garlic is intensely flavored; roasted or baked garlic is mild flavored and popular as an ingredient in appetizers and crudités.
Long believed by herbalists to possess preservative and curative powers, garlic’s beneficial effects on the immune system, efficacy in reducing cholesterol levels, and aid in lowering blood pressure are well medically documented.
Society Garlic, Tulbaghia violacea, is a related ornamental plant with pink-to-violet flowers and a bunching habit.

Garlic Plant and Care Guide
Yield:
Allow 12–16 plants per household member.
Planting:
Seed germinates in 12–14 days.
Average climates:  Plant outer cloves in full sun in early spring and again in early autumn.
Mild-Winter Climates: Plant cloves in spring, autumn, and winter, while soil temperatures remain 35–90°F (2–32°C).
Set cloves 1 in. (25 mm) deep, 4–8 in. (10–20 cm) apart, in rows 15 in. (38 cm) apart; reserve small central cloves for cooking.
Important:  Always plant nursery garlic stock; grocery garlic often is treated to prevent sprouting.
Conditions:
Growing temperature: 45–85°F (7–29°C). Zones 3–11. Garlic tolerates varied growing conditions; once stalks develop, they require 2 months at 32–50°F (0–10°C) for bulbs to fully develop.
Soil:
Moist, well-drained soil. Fertility: Rich. 5.5–6.8 pH. Prepare soil at least 1 ft. (30 cm) deep.
Care:
Moderate. Keep evenly damp during active growth; allow soil surface to dry between water applications. Apply ample water during the bulb-development stage. Fertilize monthly with 0–10–10 formula. Mulch. Cultivate. Pinch off all seed heads when they form, then lodge plants by gently doubling over stems and tying them. Lodging hastens the drying of plant tops, redirects nutrients to the root, and increases head size. After 1 month, withhold water. Garlic is susceptible to soil-borne root maggots; rotate plantings every year.
Companions:
Beets, lettuce, strawberries, summer savory, and tomatoes.
Harvest:
90–100 days. Harvest in summer. Pull heads when fully formed 2–3 weeks after lodging, brushing away any clinging soil. Allow heads to cure for 3–4 weeks in a warm, shady space protected from rain until their outer skins turn papery.
Young garlic harvested before its bulbs swell and develop into multiple cloves is called “green” or “spring” garlic. It has many uses, is uniquely flavored, and is a choice for many cooks seeking new tastes in their recipes. Chop whole and freeze or use green garlic fresh.
Storage Tips:
Fresh and dried, in a nylon net bag in a dark, dry, cool place, for 4–6 months; peeled and frozen, 6–8 months; blanched and canned or pickled, 1 year. Braid stalks of cured garlic heads into decorative strands for short-term storage.

== Gourds ==

Growing Gourds
Gourds are warm-season vining vegetables closely related to squash, pumpkins, and melons. Their species belong to two specific genera of the Cucurbitaceae family, Lagenaria and Cucurbita. The name “gourd” refers specifically to their fruit, rather than to the cucurbit plants. Melons, squash, pumpkins, and over 970 other species of cucurbits are also in the two Gourd genera and the Cucurbit family.
Gourd vines grow 10–15 ft. (3–4.5 m) long, with squash- or pumpkin-like leaves and flowers. Gourd vines bear tough-skinned, seedy fruit most often used for decoration, rustic utensils or, when dried, for bird feeders, craft birdhouses or musical instruments.
Exfoliating sponges used for cosmetic cleansing are the dried pithy cores of loofah gourds, prepared as directed in Storage Tips, below.

Gourd Plant and Care Guide
Yield:
Allow 1–2 plants of each cultivar, yielding 10–15 gourds.
Planting:
Seed germinates in 10–12 days. Average Climates:  Sow seed indoors at time of last expected frost and harden seedlings 5–7 days before transplanting. Mild-Winter Climates:  Sow seed in late winter. Set out seedlings in full sun in spring when soil warms to 68–86°F (20–30°C). Sow 2–3 seeds, 2 in. (50 mm) deep, 1 ft. (30 cm) apart, thinning to 2–4 ft. (60–120 cm) apart, in rows or hills 4 ft. (1.2 m) apart, installing trellises or support wires 3–5 ft. (90–150 cm) tall at time of planting. Separate plantings 50–75 ft. (15–23 m) to prevent cross-hybridization between cultivars.
Conditions:
Growing temperature: 50–90°F (10–32°C). Flowers may drop or fail to set fruit at temperatures below 50°F (10°C).
Soil:
Moist, well-drained, sandy soil. Fertility: Rich. 5.5–6.8 pH. Prepare soil at least 2 ft. (60 cm) deep.
Care:
Easy. Keep evenly moist; avoid wetting foliage. Withhold water when flowers appear. Fertilize only at time of planting with 5–10–10 formula. Mulch. Cultivate. Avoid direct contact of gourds with soil. Cucumber beetle and fungal disease susceptible.
Companions:
Beans, corn, and peas.
Harvest:
85–100 days. Cut fruit when vines have dried and stems turn tan, before frost. Cure for 3–4 weeks in a shady, warm dry spot until seed rattles inside when gourds are shaken.
Storage Tips:
Dried, gourds store indefinitely; enhance their beauty by painting with shellac or other clear sealing finish. For loofah sponges, cook mature fruit in barely boiling water for 4–5 hours; when sodden and pliable, cool. Remove skin and flesh from the gourds’ tough, fibrous cores, then bleach, rinse thoroughly, trim, and dry in a warm, sunny spot protected from rain. As craft projects, dry gourds also may be fashioned into dippers, birdhouses, and musical instruments.

== Husk Tomatoes and Ground Cherries ==

Growing Husk Tomatoes and Ground Cherries
Husk tomatoes, ground cherries, cape gooseberries, and tomatillos are woody, warm-season annuals or tender perennials of the nightshade family. Shrublike bushy plants, to 2–4 ft. (60–120 cm) tall, with toothed, oval leaves and bearing fruit superficially similar to green or yellow cherry tomatoes encased in a green or tan papery wrapping called a calyx.
Peeling back the caylx reveals within a green, yellow, or purple, seedy, solid fruit with flavors either sweet or tangy, depending on species and ripeness, used for making jams, pies, or salsas. Growing husk tomatoes and ground cherries is similar in cultivation to tomatoes, but they tolerate inconsistent temperatures better than tomatoes.

Fresh in husks in vegetable keeper of refrigerator for 2–3 weeks; chopped and frozen, 6 months; preserved by canning as jam, preserves, or salsa, 1 year.

== Jerusalem Artichokes or Sunchokes ==

Growing Jerusalem Artichokes
Jerusalem artichokes are a warm-season tuberous perennial root vegetable and a close relative of sunflowers. Bushy, spreading plants, 6–10 ft. (1.8–3 m) tall, topped with yellow-rayed flowers with golden centers, bear a tuber similar in appearance to a potato but flavored like a water chestnut.
Rather than containing the starches found in other tubers, Jerusalem Artichokes contain a prebiotic fiber and carbohydrate called inulin. Inulin remains unaffected by normal digestive secretions of the digestive tract but feeds probiotic (good) colon bacteria. These bacteria digest the inulin, producing byproducts of their digestion as various bowel gases.
For most, this is beneficial in producing healthy flora populations in the large intestine. In some susceptible individuals, however, ingesting large quantities of Jerusalem artichoke may cause indigestion, flatulence, or have a notable mild-to-moderate laxative effect.
Jerusalem artichoke blooms resemble yellow sunflowers, and the name Jerusalem artichoke likely derives from English corruption of the name for sunflower in Italian, girasole.

Jerusalem Artichoke Plant and Care Guide
Yield:
Allow 2–3 plants per household member.
Planting:
Tubers emerge in 10-14 days. Average Climates:  Plant tubers in full sun in spring when soil warms to 50–85°F (10–29°C). Mild-Winter Climates:  Plant tubers in late winter. Set tubers 4–6 in. (10–15 cm) deep, 2 ft. (60 cm) apart, in rows 36–40 in. (90–102 cm) apart, installing edge boards or root-guard barriers, at least 2 ft. (60 cm) deep, to prevent roots from spreading beyond the bed.
Conditions:
Growing temperature: 65–90°F (18–32°C). Zones 4–11. Tolerates hard freezes when protected under a thick layer of mulch.
Soil:
Moist, well-drained, sandy loam. Fertility: Rich. 5.8–6.2 pH. Prepare soil at least 2 ft. (60 cm) deep.
Care:
Easy. Keep evenly moist. Fertilize annually in spring with 5–10–10 formula or well-rotted manure. Mulch in winter, zones 4–7. Avoid deep cultivation that could cut the shallow, widespread tubers, 8–16 in. (20–40 cm) from the stalk, beneath the outer edge of the foliage. When leaves turn yellow in autumn, lodge or cut stalks to 3 in. (75 mm) above soil, or lift several tubers as seed stalk, and store them over winter packed in loose, damp sawdust, placed in a cool, dry location. Carefully remove all tubers from soil to prevent volunteer shoots from sprouting. Pest and disease resistant.
Companions:
Corn, peanuts, and rhubarb.
Harvest:
110–150 days. Lift tubers with a garden fork when flowers fade and they are 3–4 in. (75–100 mm) wide. Best flavor when harvested after light frost.
Storage Tips:
Best if eaten fresh or preserved immediately after harvest. Store fresh in vegetable keeper of refrigerator for 2–3 weeks; in damp sawdust in a dark, cool location, 6 months; in ground, throughout winter. Lacking starches that turn to sugar during digestion because they contain a complex carbohydrate, inulin, they are an excellent alternative to rice and potatoes for diabetics. They are prized raw, peeled and sliced in salads and sprinkled on pizza. Sliced and dehydrated, they can be eaten as chips or crisps, or milled into flour to make pasta. Grill, bake, or roast them into vegetarian entrees or side dishes. As ornamental plantings, they also provide effective and attractive windbreaks.

== Kale ==

Growing Kale
Kale is a leafy green, cool-season vegetable. Either curly edged or smooth, plants grow to 2 ft. (60 cm) tall, with blue, gray, green, white, yellow, or red-veined leaves. Kale is a cole-family vegetable.

== Leek ==

Growing Leeks
Leeks are cool-season, erect root vegetables with edible leaves and are a milder-flavored relative of onions, also in the Allium family. Leeks have stems of white turning green, 24–30 in. (60–75 cm) tall. They are topped with deep-green, fanlike foliage.
Leeks are one of 750–860 recognized species within the Allium genus, and are counted among the 280 different species of the Allium subgenus that also contains most edible onion relatives.
Leeks grown for food are domesticated, improved varieties, cultivars, and hybrids of a wild and often weedy leek species originally native to northern Africa, southern Europe, the Near East, and Southwest Asia. Considerable variation is evident within the domesticated leeks. They are cultivated worldwide in suitable climates.
Leeks mature slowly and are prized for their mild, yet zesty flavor. They typically are blanched during growth to produce the tender, white stalks favored for most culinary uses. With potato, chicken broth, and cream, leeks are a principal ingredient of vichyssoise, a cold soup, and also its warm companion, potato-leek soup.
Elephant Garlic (Allium ampeloprasum) is a distant relative of leeks and of the same family.

== Crisphead or Iceberg Lettuce ==

Growing Crisphead or Iceberg Lettuce
Crisphead and Iceberg (the most popular crisphead cultivar) are leafy green, head-forming, cool-season vegetables. With their firm, compact heads of pale green, crisp leaves on a basal rosette of open leaves, the tight, perfect spheres of crisphead are both the most frequently grown and the most challenging lettuce to grow.
Fortunately, the flavor and texture of open-leaved crispheads are every bit as tasty as their idealized sisters. Their unique character is featured in the popular but simple wedge salad, a quartered head of Iceberg topped with a tangy dressing and optional bacon bits.
Another popular way to enjoy crisphead lettuce is in Southeast Asian, Chinese, and Korean lettuce wraps (ssambap or ssam). Try both vegetarian and mixed meat-and-vegetable wraps during hot summer days. Heat triggers this lettuce variety to form tight, large-leaved heads. Their leaves are perfect for replacing rice- or wheat-dough wrappers in steamed dumplings and raw treats.

== Bitter Melons or Cucamelons ==

Growing Bitter Melons and Cucamelons
Bitter melons or cucamelons (Melothria scabra) are slow-growing tuberous, warm-season vegetables. They are in the same Cucurbitaceae family as cucumbers and several summer melons. Because they are rarely sold commercially, they are fun to grow at home.
They bear several other common names, including mouse melon, Mexican melon, Mexican sour gherkin, and sandita (“little watermelon” in Spanish.) Bitter melons originally were native to Central America and the northern countries of South America.
These tubers share the common name of ‘bitter melon’ with several other edible plants, including Momordica charantia—a widely-distributed subtropical vine and another member of the squash family—and peppino (Solanum muricatum)—a South American herbaceous shrub and member of the nightshade family related to potatoes.
These bitter melons are subtropical plants and require protection from both heat and cold while bearing fruit. They grow on vines that often reach 10 ft. (3 m) tall. Yellow, tomato-like flowers produce numerous one-inch fruit that resemble miniature watermelons, zebra-striped cherry tomatoes, or grapes. The fruit has the crunchy texture of cucumbers and tastes tangy, sour or citrus-like. Both their skin and flesh are edible.
Plant bitter melon as seed in mid-spring after soils warm, or as tubers in late spring. First fruit ripens in 120-160 days and they bear into autumn until their flowers stop setting fruit as cooler weather begins. Lift the tubers for replanting after the vines die.

Summer Melon Plant and Care Guide
Yield:
Allow 1–2 plants per household member. Vines produce continuously in small–moderate quantities.
Planting:
Best in U.S.D.A. plant hardiness zones 9–11. Seed germinates in 10–14 days in sunny conditions and warm temperatures 70°F (21°C), but may require 24 days or longer under cooler or varied conditions. Early Starts: Plant indoors in large pots 8-10 weeks prior to last expected frost. Sow seed on soil surface and cover with 1/4-in. (6-mm) of soil; Plant tubers 1 in. (25 mm) deep. Water and set the pots in a warm, sunny spot or position them under grow-lights. Outdoor Plantings: Sow seed in full sun when soil warms to 70–80°F (21–27°C). Sow 2–3 seeds, 1/4-in. (6-mm) deep, 3 ft. (90 cm) apart, thinning to 2 plants per drill, in rows 4–5 ft. (120–150 cm) apart, or in mounds spaced 4 ft. (120 cm) apart. Plant single tubers 1 in. (25 mm) deep, as you would sweet potatoes, spaced as for seed plantings. Install sturdy wooden stake supports, wires, or trellises at time of planting.
Conditions:
Best growing temperature: 70–85°F (21–30°C). Requires sustained temperatures between 70–85°F (21–30°C) to set flowers and develop fruit; flowers may drop if temperatures during bloom exceed 90°F (32°C).
Soil:
Moist, well-drained soil. Fertility: Rich. 6.0–6.8 pH. Prepare soil at least 2 ft. (60 cm) deep. Tubers: Pre-fertilize 2–3 in. (50-75 mm) below the surface with 5–10–10 formula and cover with 1–2 in. (25–50 mm) of soil before setting tubers in the planting hole, then cover with unfertilized soil. Avoid succession or repeat-season plantings of bitter melons in soils previously used to grow cucumbers, bitter melons, or potatoes.
Care:
Moderate to challenging. Keep evenly moist; avoid wetting foliage. Train vines onto supports as they grow. Protect from exposure during periods of wind and cool or hot temperatures. Apply ample water during the flowering and fruit-development stages. Fertilize monthly with 10–10–10 formula. Cultivate. Lift tubers in autumn, cure, and store them in an unheated, dry location for replanting in late spring. Squash-vine borer and powdery mildew, fusarium wilt susceptible.
Companions:
Sweet potatoes, corn, pole beans, scarlet-runner beans, and morning glory.
Harvest:
100–120 days. Pick bitter melons when husks of fruit begin to soften. Eat raw whole or sliced, in beverages or in aqua fresca. Pickle or preserve in jams.
Storage Tips:
Fresh in refrigerator for 1 week; preserved or pickled, 1 year.

== Onions ==

Growing Onions
Onions are cool-season bulb vegetables. They have sturdy green foliage and swollen roots with papery tunicate layers covering their many concentric layers of crisp, juicy, distinctively pungent flesh. An onion-family—allium— vegetable.
Onions are phototropic, regulating their growth by the hours of sunlight they receive. Long-Day onion varieties grow best in mid- to high-latitude areas from 30°–50° north or south, while Short-Day onion varieties perform best in low- to mid-latitude areas from 15°–25° north or south. If unsure, choose Intermediate-Day or Day-Neutral onion varieties.
Onions and their close relatives—chives, garlic, leeks, and shallots—are very popular garden vegetables to sow from seed, set out as seedlings, or plant as sets—immature bulbs are available in autumn and spring. Harvest onions while young and green as scallions or when mature as brown, red, or white bulbs that easily dry and store well.
Ornamental Onion (Allium spp.) and Society Garlic (Tulbaghia violacea) are related ornamental bulbs frequently planted in landscapes and flower beds.

Soil:
Moist, well-drained sandy soil. Fertility: Rich. 6–6.8 pH. Prepare soil at least 1 ft. (30 cm) deep. Rotate plantings with other vegetables to prevent accumulation of pest and disease organisms in soil.
Care:
Easy. Keep evenly moist. Apply ample water during the bulb-enlargement stage. Fertilize monthly during active growth with 5–10–10 formula. Mulch deeply to protect from frost. Cultivate.
Lodge foliage of bulb-forming varieties when seed heads form and flowers open; for bunching cultivars, trim off flowers and withered stalks. Borer, thrip and nematode susceptible.
Companions:
Beets, lettuce, summer savory, strawberries, and tomatoes.
Harvest:
80–150 days. Pull green onion bulbs while less than 1/2 in. (12 mm) wide; harvest bunching cultivars when bulbs are 1–2 in. (25–50 mm) wide, thinning from the outside of the bunch; pull drying onion bulbs when 3–5 in. (75–125 mm) wide and tops wither. Harvest promptly; leaving onions in ground causes mushy texture, bulb division.
Storage Tips:
Green and Bunching: Fresh in vegetable keeper of refrigerator for 2–3 weeks; chopped and frozen, 6–8 months. Drying: Cut 1–1⁄2 in. (38 mm) above the bulb or braid the stems into strands, cure 10–20 days in a shady, warm, dry spot, and store in a porous fabric bag in a cool, dry place, 4–6 months; chop, dry in a vegetable dehydrator, and seal in airtight plastic containers, 1 year; chop and freeze, 6–8 months.

== Hot or Chili Peppers ==

Growing Hot or Chili Peppers
Hot peppers are warm-season, tender perennial vegetables. Bushy, upright plants, to 3 ft. (90 cm) tall, bear oval leaves and gold, green, red, yellow peppers, 1–7 in. (25–178 mm) long, ranging from mild to fiery hot depending on their capsaicin content.
The heat of hot peppers varies according to their care, even those picked from the same plant or from hour to hour.
Peppers of all types are tender to both cold and high temperatures. Note the ideal temperatures best suited to production in the Conditions section of the Hot Pepper Plant Guide.
Would you like to overwinter peppers as mature plants so you may enjoy fruit earlier in the season? Full directions follow the Hot Pepper Plant and Care Guide table, below.
Grow mild pepper varieties rather than hot peppers for use for salads and toppings.

Hot Pepper Plant and Care Guide
Yield:
Plants per household member depend on pepper cultivar. Read care tag or seed package data carefully when estimating yield.
Planting:
Seed germinates in 10–12 days. Average Climates:  Sow seed indoors, 5–8 in. (13–20 cm) apart in a planting tray 4–6 in. (10–15 cm) deep filled with loose potting soil, 6–8 weeks before soil is expected to warm to 65–90°F (18–32°C) and harden seedlings 5–7 days before transplanting. Mild-Winter Climates: Sow seed in full sun in spring. Sow 2 seeds, 1/2-in. (12-mm) deep, 18–24 in. (45–60 cm) apart, thinning to 1 plant per drill, in rows 28–36 in. (70–90 cm) apart. Plant successions every 3–4 weeks.
Conditions:
Hot peppers are tender perennials, ground hardy in U.S.D.A. hardiness zones 9–11, and may be lifted and overwintered indoors in cold climate areas once they are semi-dormant due to nighttime temperatures below 60°F (16°C).
Protect or shelter plants at temperatures lower than 55°F (13°C) for more than four hours.
Though they may be spicy and hot tasting, all peppers require shade from direct hot sun and temperatures higher than 85°F (30°C). Flowers stop setting fruit above 85°F (30°C) and may drop in temperatures over 90–100°F (32–38°C). Set fruit may drop at temperatures over 105°F (41°C).
Misting and shade may help peppers survive short-duration heat events; they typically resume production as temperatures moderate.
Soil:
Moist, well-drained, sandy loam. Fertility: Rich. 5.5–6.8 pH. Prepare soil at least 30 in. (75 cm) deep. Avoid planting in sites previously used to grow eggplants, peppers, or tomatoes to prevent accumulation of disease organisms in soil.
Care:
Moderate. Keep evenly moist; allow soil surface to dry between waterings. Fertilize monthly with 5–10–10 formula. Mulch. Cultivate. Aphid, cutworm, pepper weevil, and whitefly susceptible.
Full directions about how grow pepper plants as perennials, overwinter them, and replant them the following year in order to have an earlier and longer production of harvests, follow this table, below.
Companions:
Beets, garlic, onions, and parsnips.
Harvest:
60–95 days. Pick when full colored and desired size; chill after harvesting. Harvest frequently to extend development of new flowers and fruit. Water deeply 4–8 hours before harvest for mildest peppers; withhold watering 1–2 days to enhance piquant flavor.
Storage Tips:
Fresh in vegetable keeper of refrigerator for 1 week; roasted, peeled, and frozen, 6 months; dried, 1 year; processed as pickled peppers and canned, 2 years. Dry peppers by laying them out loosely in flats in the sun, using a vegetable dehydrator, or weaving and hanging as decorative strands. Pepper seeds can be ground into powder in a food mill for use as seasoning.
Warning:  Pods and seed of hot peppers contain capsaicin, a powerful eye and skin irritant. Always wear gloves when caring for or harvesting hot or chili pepper varieties.

== Sweet Peppers ==

Growing Sweet and Mild Peppers
Sweet peppers are warm-season tender perennial vegetables typically grown as annual plants in temperate climates. Bushy, compact plants, 18–24 in. (45–60 cm) tall, bear oval leaves and gold, green, orange, purple, red, yellow peppers.
Popular varieties of sweet and mild peppers include banana, bell, oval, round, and tear shaped. These peppers have many forms and varied degrees of heat. Some sweet pepper cultivars are nearly as spicy as their near relatives, the hot peppers, and require special care at harvest to manage their flavor.
Would you like to overwinter peppers as mature plants so you may enjoy fruit earlier in the season? Full directions follow the Hot Pepper Plant and Care Guide table, below.

Dry peppers by laying them out in loose flats in the sun, using a vegetable dehydrator, or weaving and hanging as decorative strands. Sweet peppers can be eaten raw, roasted, sautéed, or chopped for cooking in stir-fried dishes and casseroles; or pickled whole or in relishes. Sweet peppers are a principal ingredient of Mexican chile rellenos—roasted, peeled and seeded, stuffed with cheese, dipped into beaten egg whites and fried.

== Potatoes ==

Growing Potatoes
Potatoes are cool-season perennial, deciduous tubers, a popular root vegetable in the Nightshade family. A close relative of tomatoes and peanuts, they have bushy, somewhat vining plants, to 2 ft. (60 cm) tall, bearing purple, white flowers and many oval, round, finger-shaped, or clustered, brown, purple, red, tan, or yellow tubers at their roots.
Flavor and texture vary by cultivar. Cultivars are classified as early, mid­season, or late season based on the length of time required for maturity. Choose disease-free or resistant cultivars known to be successful in your region.
Potato varieties also differ in growth habit. Some are indeterminate—they produce successive waves of new tubers as their roots develop—while others are determinate and produce only one set of tubers at their roots during the seasonal growth cycle.

Potato Plant and Care Guide
Yield:
Allow 4–5 plants per household member, yielding 20–50 potatoes.
Planting:
Seed potato cuttings germinate in 10-14 days.
Early Cultivars—Average Climates:  Sow in full sun in spring 4–6 weeks before last expected frost. Mild-Summer Climates: Sow in late spring.
Midseason Cultivars—Sow in spring when soil warms to 50–85°F (10–29°C).
Late Cultivars—Sow in late spring. Cut seed potatoes into segments with at least 2 eyes, dust cut surfaces with garden lime, and plant 2–3 in. (50–75 mm) deep, 10–14 in. (25–35 cm) apart, in rows 30–36 in. (75–90 cm) apart.
When sprouts emerge, add 2 in. (5 cm) of soil over the planting to prevent tubers from greening.
Indeterminate Potatoes—Plant indeterminate potato types—including Amarosa, Bangcock, Bintje, German Butterball, Elba, Nicola, Royal Blue, Russet, Russian Blue, Sarpo Mira, and Snowden—4 in (10 cm) deep. When sprouts appear and two sets of leaves have formed vertically on the leaf stalk, bury them with loose soil to the top of their foliage, making a hill.
Repeat as each successive two pairs of leaves set. Continue until the entire hill is layered 18 in. (45 cm) deep, then allow the plants’ foliage to grow normally, set flowers, and die back before digging. Hills will form potatoes on each set of roots in the planting, producing a bountiful harvest.
Conditions:
45–80°F (7–27°C); needs vary by cultivar. Zones 2–10.
Soil:
Damp, well-drained, sandy soil. Fertility: Rich. 4.8–5.4 pH. Prepare soil at least 2 ft. (60 cm) deep.
Care:
Easy. Keep evenly damp; allow soil to dry between waterings. Withhold water 2 weeks before harvest. Fertilize only at planting with 5–10–10 formula. Mulch. Cultivate until flowers form. Borer, grub and fungal disease susceptible.
Companions:
Beans, cabbage, corn, eggplant, horseradish, and marigolds.
Harvest:
Early: 90–110 days.
Midseason: 100–120 days.
Late: 110–140 days.
Harvest new potatoes when flowers begin to fade; mature potatoes, when foliage withers, digging carefully with a garden fork, 8–10 in. (20–25 cm) from stalk and working inward to the vine. Harvest promptly. Brush clinging soil from tubers.
Storage Tips:
Fresh, stored in a cool, dark, well-ventilated spot, for 6 months; avoid refrigeration. Use new potatoes immediately.
Warning: Stems, leaves, potato eyes and any green skin areas on potato tubers are a poison hazard if ingested.

== Pumpkins ==

Growing Pumpkins
Pumpkins are warm-season, vining vegetables. Plants grow vines, 5–20 ft. (1.5–6 m) long, bearing large, gold, flute-shaped, male and female, edible flowers that set orange or white, round or oval, squash­like fruit with a thick, smooth rind scored with vertical grooves.
Pumpkins range in size from tiny to huge, depending on cultivar. Grow them for their orange or white flesh, which can be baked or steamed, for seed to roast for eating, or as decorative displays in seasonal decor.
The pumpkins used to make canned and fresh pie fillings frequently are a squash relative, Cucurbita maxima ‘Lumina’ or one of its many relatives. It is a white-skinned, orange-fleshed squash with very sweet, thick, and dense flesh—perfect for pies.
Giant pumpkins, Cucurbita maxima, some growing to 1,500 lbs. (600 kg) or heavier, are actually a separate species from traditional edible pumpkins, Cucurbita pepo.

Pumpkin Plant and Care Guide
Yield:
Allow 1–2 plants of each cultivar per household member.
Planting:
Seed germinates in 8–10 days.
Average Climates: Sow seeds or transplant seedlings in full sun in late spring when soil warms to 65–90°F (18–32°F).
Hot or Arid Climates: in summer after heat has broken and 4 months of mild weather remain.
Sow 5–6 seeds, 1 in. (25 mm) deep, 3–4 in. (75–100 mm) apart, thinning to 2–3 plants per mound, raised 6–10 in. (15–25 cm) high and 2 ft. (60 cm) wide, 6–8 ft. (1.8–2.4 m) apart, installing sturdy tripod supports at time of planting.
Conditions:
50–90°F (10–32°C). Best in warm, dry climates.
Soil:
Moist, well-drained soil. Fertility: Rich. 6.0–7.5 pH. Prepare soil at least 2 ft. (60 cm) deep.
Care:
Easy. Keep evenly moist; avoid wetting foliage. Fertilize monthly with 5–10–10 formula until flowers form. For largest pumpkins, after 2–3 reach 2–3 in. (50–75 mm) wide, remove remaining female flowers with immature fruit beneath their blossoms and leave male, pollen-bearing flowers. Protect fruit from direct contact with soil. Aphid, cucumber beetle, vine borer, squash bug and fungal disease susceptible.
Companions:
Corn, squash, sunflowers.
Harvest:
90–120 days. Cut pumpkins when full colored and desired size, rinds resist a fingernail’s penetration, and the vines have withered; use sharp hand shears and leave 4 in. (10 cm) of stem on the fruit. Best flavor after first frost. Cure in garden after cutting for use as holiday decoration.
Storage Tips:
For best fresh storage, cure in garden in direct sun at 75–80°F (24–27°C) for 2 weeks after harvest. Stored in a cool, dry spot for 3 months; pureed and frozen, 6 months; cooked and canned, 1 year. Personalize children’s pumpkins by scoring their soft, green rind before they reach full size; the scratches will harden into a white callus as they mature.

== Radish or Daikon ==

Growing Radishes or Daikon
Radishes and their close relatives, long and white-rooted Daikon, are cool-season, annual or biennial root vegetables. Deeply toothed, rough-textured leaves rise from swollen, black, cream, purple, red, yellow, or multicolored roots with mostly white flesh. They vary in form from carrotlike to globe or egg-shaped and from small to quite large.
Radishes range from zesty mild to very spicy, depending on cultivar. Table cultivars form seed when they mature, as do most annuals; Asian cultivars may overwinter and form seed the second season as biennials.

Radish Planting and Care Guide
Yield:
Allow 15–20 plants per household member.
Planting:
Seed germinates in 4–6 days.
Average Climates:  Sow seed in full sun–partial shade in spring when soil warms to 45–85°F (7–29°C), or in autumn.
Mild-Winter Climates:  Sow seed in late autumn–early winter.
Autumn–Winter Gardens: Sow seed in August to mid-September for harvest Winter–Spring.
Sow 1 seed, 1/2-in. (12-mm) deep, 1 in. (25 mm) apart, thinning to 4 in. (10 cm) apart, in mounded rows raised 4–8 in. (10–20 cm) tall and 6 in. (15 cm) wide, 10–16 in. (25–40 cm) apart.
Plant successions every 2 weeks.
Conditions:
50–75°F (10–24°C). Zones 3–10. Shade plants in full sunlight at temperatures over 85°F (29°C).
Soil:
Moist, well-drained, sandy loam. Fertility: Rich. 5.5–6.8 pH. Prepare soil at least 1 ft. (30 cm) deep. Rotate plantings to prevent accumulation of pest larvae in soil.
Care:
Easy. Keep evenly moist; allow soil surface to dry between waterings. Fertilize only at time of planting with 5–10–10 formula or well-rotted manure. Root maggot susceptible.
Companions:
Cucumbers, lettuce, nasturtiums, peas, and peppers.
Harvest:
22–70 days. Pull roots when full colored and 1 in. (25 mm) wide, rinsing and chilling after harvest; avoid removing tops. Harvest promptly; leaving radishes in ground past maturity causes hollowing, cracking, and pithy texture combined with a bitter flavor remniscent of earthy soil.
Storage Tips:
Fresh in vegetable keeper of refrigerator for 3–4 weeks. Use raw whole radishes as crudités, or slice them for use as a garnish in green salads; sliced fresh radishes also can be added to Asian stir-fried dishes.

== Rhubarb ==

Growing Rhubarb
Rhubarb is a cool-season perennial and edible-ornamental plant, to 3 ft. (90 cm) tall and wide, bearing broad leaves on edible fleshy stalks of green, red, and red-tinged to white, 10–15 in. (25–38 cm) long.
There are 60 to over 100 different varieties of rhubarb popularly grown around the world, and one or more grow in U.S.D.A. plant hardiness zones 2–9. Choose those cultivars known to be successful in your region.
Rhubarb’s stalks provide a tangy ingredient for making sauces, pies and condiments. Rhubarb may require up to 4 years before it produces a full harvest. Often grown as a garden ornamental for its attractive foliage.
Popular varieties include ‘Cherry Red’, ‘Chipman’s Canada Red’, ‘Granddad’s Favourite’, ‘Holstein Bloodred’, ‘Kangahru’, ‘Riverside Giant’, ‘Timperley Early’, ‘Turkish’, and ‘Victoria’.

Rhubarb Plant and Care Guide
Yield:
Allow 2–3 plants per household member, yielding 4–6 lbs. (1.8–2.7 kg) of rhubarb stalks.
Planting:
Seed germinates in 14–21 days; root divisions, 16–25 days.
Average Climates: Sow seed or plant root divisions in full sun–partial shade in early spring when soil warms to 40–85°F (5–29°C).
Mild-Winter Climates:  Plant root divisions in autumn after summer heat has broken and 3–4 months of mild weather remain.
Set out root divisions 3–4 in. (75–100 mm) deep, 2–3 ft. (60–90 cm) apart, in mounded rows raised 6–8 in. (15–20 cm) tall and 18 in. (45 cm) wide, 4–6 ft. (1.2–1.8 m) apart.
Conditions:
35–75°F (2–24°C). Rhubarb is cold-hardy, ground-hardy in U.S.D.A. zones 4–9a, and hardy to zone 2 if planted in soil protected from hard freezes (see recommendations below).
Best in mild, cool-summer climates. Shade plants in full sunlight at temperatures over 85°F (29°C). Harvest until dormancy in zones 5–9.
In cold-winter regions, zones 2-4, cease harvesting in July so that leaves may provide nutrients to the root crown and roots of the plants to help them survive long winter dormancy. Burying crowns and mulching over them in these zones helps prevent freeze-thaw cycles that otherwise would kill the plants.
Soil:
Moist, well-drained loam. Fertility: Rich. 5.0–6.8 pH. Prepare soil at least 30 in. (75 cm) deep.
Care:
Easy. Keep evenly moist. Fertilize at time of planting and after each harvest with 5–10–5 formula. Cultivate using care to avoid cutting the widespread, shallow roots.
In cold-winter climates, removing all dead stems and foliage to the crown in autumn after frost, mulch with 1–2 ft. (30–60 cm) of straw, and cover with 1–2 in. (25–50 mm) of soil; uncover in spring when soil is workable. In mild-winter climates, light mulching after foliage dies is sufficient to protect the root crown from frost damage.
Replant with new stock or by dividing root crowns after 4 harvests. Pest and disease resistant.
Companions:
Artichokes, asparagus, and cole vegetables.
Harvest:
Requires 2–4 years for first full harvest. Cut stalks when stems reach 2 ft. (60 cm) long, thinning outer stalks and leaving the central growth bud and 4–6 leaves to resprout.
Allow new leaves to mature before cutting, about 4–6 weeks between harvests. Cease harvesting 4–6 weeks before first hard frost.
Cut and remove any flower stalks as they appear.
Storage Tips:
Fresh in vegetable keeper of refrigerator for 2–4 weeks; cut, blanched, and frozen, 3–4 months; processed as sauce or pie fillings and frozen, 1 year; processed and canned, 3 years. Chop tart, stringy rhubarb stalks into pieces 1–2 in. (25–50 mm) long, cover with water, boil, and add sugar to taste to make tangy sauce for hotcakes, waffles, and ice cream.
Warning:  Foliage of rhubarb is fatally toxic if ingested. Avoid planting in areas frequented by children and pets.

== Salsify or Oyster Plant ==

Growing Salsify or Oyster Plant
Salsify is a biennial, cool-season root vegetable. Salsify is narrow, long, and carrot-shaped. Young salsify is both tender and mild; with maturity, plants become strong flavored and stringy textured, with strap-shaped foliage, 2–4 ft. (60–120 cm) tall.
Salsify is often called “vegetable oyster” by vegans and vegetarians for its striking seafood flavor that varies, depending on the root’s age and growing conditions.
In its first season, salsify produces grasslike foliage up to 12 in. (30 cm) long around its growth point and developing root. Left to overwinter and grow a second season, it blooms with a ball-shaped, purple flower reminiscent of onion, matures seed, then dies.
Black or Spanish salsify, Scorzonera hispanica, is distant relative of true salsify, Tragopogon porrifolius, with black-skinned roots and white flesh. It has similar culture, care, and uses, but is a member of the sunflower family.

Moist, well-drained, sandy loam. Fertility: Rich. 6.0–6.8 pH. Prepare soil at least 2 ft. (60 cm) deep.
Care:
Easy. Keep evenly moist. Fertilize only at time of planting with 5–10–5 formula. Mulch in hot-summer climates. Cultivate. Pest and disease resistant.
Companions:
Carrots, potatoes, rutabagas, sweet potatoes, and turnips.
Harvest:
120–150 days. Harvest as needed when 6–12 in. (15–30 cm) long, digging carefully with a garden fork. In cold-winter climates before the first hard freeze, mulch with 1–2 ft. (30–60 cm) of straw and 1–2 in. (25–50 mm) of soil.
Storage Tips:
Fresh in ground for 3–4 months; in vegetable keeper of refrigerator, 3–4 weeks; diced, steamed, and frozen, 6 months. Substitute salsify for oyster whenever the shellfish’s flavor is desired: eat raw slices as crudités; boiled and mashed on crackers as canapés; or battered with egg and cracker crumbs and fried in butter as mock oysters.

== Shallots ==

Growing Shallots
Shallots are cool-season perennial bulb vegetables and close relatives of onion. Shallots have narrow, hollow leaves, to 2 ft. (60 cm) tall, and grow in a bunching habit to form groups of pungent, swollen roots containing garliclike cloves.
The cloves of shallot are 3/4–1-1/2-in. (19–38-mm) wide, with a flavor midway between onion and garlic. Each clove is protected by a brown papery sheath.
Shallots left in the ground from season to season eventually divide into multiple plants, called “shallot bunches.”

Shallot Plant and Care Guide
Yield:
Allow 4–6 plants per household member.
Planting:
Seed germinates in 10–12 days.
Average climates:  Plant outer cloves in full sun in early spring and again in early autumn.
Mild-Winter Climates: Plant cloves in spring, autumn, and winter, while soil temperatures remain 35–90°F (2–32°C).
Plant individual cloves, broad end down, with 1/2-in. (12-mm) of soil to cover, 5–8 in. (13–20 cm) apart, in rows 2–4 ft. (60–120 cm) apart.
Shallots require a 1-month dormant period after planting, with temperatures of 32–50°F (0–10°C).
Conditions:
40–85°F (4–29°C). Zones 3–9. Best in cold-winter climates, requiring warmth to develop bulbs.
Soil:
Moist, well-drained, sandy loam. Fertility: Rich. 5.0–6.8 pH. Avoid planting in sites previously used to grow garlic to prevent accumulation of pest organisms in soil.
Care:
Easy. Keep evenly moist. Fertilize annually in spring with 5–10–10 formula. Mulch over bunches when sprouts emerge with organic compost in a layer 1–2 in. (25–50 mm) deep. Cultivate. Lodge stalks intended for harvest when 16–18 in. (40–45 cm) tall, 3–4 weeks before planned harvest date. Pest and disease susceptible; choose resistant cultivars.
Companions:
Beets, lettuce, strawberries, summer savory, and tomatoes.
Harvest:
60–120 days. Harvest in summer when tops wither. Separate heads carefully from the bunch with a hand trowel or fork. Cure harvested bulbs for 2–3 weeks in a sunny, warm, dry area before use or storage.
Storage Tips:
Fresh, in a porous fabric bag in a dark, cool, dry spot, for 6 months; minced, packed into ice cube trays, frozen, and sealed in airtight containers, 1 year. Substitute shallots for onions in quiches, omelets, and delicately flavored dishes, or sauté with wine and butter to make sauces for red meat dishes. Chopped raw shallot greens can be used as a garnish, as for chives.

== Garden Spinach, New Zealand Spinach, and Malabar Spinach ==

Growing Spinach and Spinach-Like Plants
Cool-season Garden Spinach and warm-season Malabar or New Zealand spinach are annual vegetables.
Depending on species:
Garden spinach (Spinacia oleracea) is a deep-green, cool-season annual native to central Asia;
New Zealand spinach or Warrigal greens (Tetragonia tetragonioides)  is a bright-green, warm-season, bushy or trailing annual with yellow flowers native to New Zealand; and
Malabar spinach (Basella alba) is a dark-green, warm-season, tender perennial vine native to India.
 
The three forms grown in home gardens are unrelated species. Choose cultivars known to be successful in your region.
See also: Amaranth, (Amaranthus tricolor and A. cruentus), two very colorful, warm-season, and close relatives to garden spinach, also grown for their succulent leaves.

(75 mm) above the soil, leaving the central growth bud to sprout additional leaves. Harvest promptly; leaves left on plants have gritty texture due to silica crystals in mature cell walls.  New Zealand and Malabar Spinach: 50–75 days. Cut leaves when 3–5 in. (75–125 mm) long, every 5–7 days, until the first frost.
Storage Tips:
Fresh in vegetable keeper of refrigerator for 10–14 days; blanched, chilled, and frozen, 4–6 months.

== Summer Squash ==

Growing Summer Squash
Summer squash—crookneck, scallop, straightneck, and zucchini—are warm-season vining vegetables. Squash plants bear vines with large, hairy leaves with many black, orange, yellow, and multicolored, round, oval, gourdlike, tubular, scallop-edged, or crookneck-shaped squash, their fruit.
The fruit and flowers of summer squash are versatile in their many kitchen uses, from raw to steamed, sautéed, boiled, baked, stir-fried, deep-fried, or grilled on a barbecue.
See also: Winter Squash. Varieties of the same two species as summer squash, the winter squash take a bit longer to mature, and benefit from early indoor plantings of starts for transplant.

Summer Squash Plant and Care Guide
Yield:
Allow 1–2 plants of each cultivar per household member.
Planting:
Seed germinates in 8–10 days.
Average Climates:  Sow seed or transplant seedlings in full sun in spring when soil warms to 60–85°F (16–29°C).
Mild-Winter Climates:  Sow seed in late summer.
Sow 4–5 seeds, 2–3 in. (50–75 mm) deep, 3–4 in. (75–100 mm) apart, thinning to 2 plants per drill, in hills raised 1 ft. (30 cm) high and 2 ft. (60 cm) wide, 6–8 ft. (1.8–2.4 m) apart, or in rows 3–5 ft. (90–150 cm) apart, installing sturdy tripod supports at time of planting.
Conditions:
60–75°F (16–24°C).
Soil:
Moist, well-drained soil. Fertility: Rich. 5.5–6.8 pH. Prepare soil at least 30 in. (75 cm) deep.
Care:
Easy. Keep evenly moist; avoid wetting foliage or fruit. Fertilize monthly with 5–10–10 formula. Cultivate. Keep heavy fruits from direct soil contact by placing squash on boards or suspend hanging fruit from supports with bird-netting cradles. Aphid, vine borer, squash bug and fungal disease susceptible.
Companions:
Beans, nasturtiums, and bush peas.
Harvest:
50–65 days. Cut squash when the rind is tender and before seeds mature.
Storage Tips:
Fresh in vegetable compartment of refrigerator for 2–3 weeks; cooked and frozen, 6–8 months. Eat summer squash whole or sliced: steamed, boiled, broiled, or buttered, wrapped in foil, and grilled or baked. Squash blossoms, dipped in batter and fried until golden and crunchy, are a delicacy and a sure means of limiting squash production.

== Winter Squash ==

Growing Winter Squash
Winter squash—three distinct species that include acorn, banana, buttercup, crookneck pumpkin, Hubbard, spaghetti, and turban squash—are vining, warm season annual vegetables. They are plants with large, hairy leaves bearing many black, green, orange, yellow, and multicolored, round, oval, club-shaped, or asymmetrical squash with thick rinds and containing succulent flesh with varied textures and flavors, 4–30 in. (10–75 cm) long and wide.
Grilling, boiling, and baking are typical recipe uses of winter squash. Once cooked, squash may be mashed, sliced,or grated as a main or side ingredient of casseroles, pies, stews, or soups.
Fully ripe and cured winter squash are highly durable, lasting 3–4 months or more under ideal storage conditions.
See also: Summer Squash. Varieties of two species that also include winter squash, the summer squash mature earlier in the season. You’ll benefit from early indoor plantings of starts for transplant, providing late spring or early summer fruit for your meals.

Winter Squash Plant and Care Guide
Yield:
Allow 1–2 plants of each cultivar per household member.
Planting:
Seed germinates in 8–10 days.
Average Climates:  Sow seed or transplant seedlings in full sun in spring when soil warms to 65–85°F (18–29°C).
Mild-Winter Climates:  Sow seed in spring and early autumn.
Sow 4–5 seeds, 2–3 in. (50–75 mm) deep, 3–4 in. (75–100 mm) apart, thinning to 2 plants per drill, in hills raised 1 ft. (30 cm) high and 2 ft. (60 cm) wide, 6–8 ft. (1.8–2.4 m) apart, or in rows 3–6 ft. (90–180 cm) apart, installing sturdy tripod supports at time of planting.

Care:
Easy. Keep evenly moist; avoid wetting foliage or fruit. Fertilize monthly with 5–10–10 formula. Cultivate. Keep heavy fruits from direct soil contact by placing squash on boards. Aphid, vine borer, squash bug and fungal disease susceptible.
Companions:
Beans, nasturtiums, and bush peas.
Harvest:
60–110 days. Cut when rinds are full colored—some acorn squash remain green, with semi-hard rinds—and stems become hard and dry, before frost; cut squash stems 2–4 in. (50–100 mm) from fruit with hand shears and wipe away any clinging soil. Avoid washing squash.
Storage Tips:
For best fresh storage, cure in garden in direct sun at 75–80°F (24–27°C) for 2 weeks after harvest. Fresh, stored in a cool, dry spot, for 3–4 months; cooked and frozen, 4–6 months; cooked and canned, 1 year. Exposure to frost concentrates sugars for better flavor and texture. Spaghetti squash, a novelty, is prepared by roasting slices drizzled with olive oil, then using a fork to free its spaghetti-like strands from the rind for use in vegetarian dishes with cream or marinara sauces, butter, or olive oil.

== Sunflowers ==

Growing Sunflowers
Sunflowers are prolific seed-bearing, warm-season annuals of the many-species Helianthus family, and relatives of Jerusalem artichokes.
An ornamental plant, usually 5–12 ft. (1.5–3.7 m) tall, though dwarf cultivars of small stature are available, bear broad, toothed leaves and golden yellow, many-rayed, composite flowers, 4–18 in. (10–45 cm) wide with a pithy, central bed containing up to several hundred tasty seed.
Sunflowers attract pollinating bees and seed-eating wild birds, create borders, and beautify vegetable gardens.
They were originally native to the western half of North America from the Pacific to the Plains, but are now introduced worldwide and grown commercially for their seed and oil.
Gardeners should note that sunflowers are prohibited or classified as noxious weeds in some jurisdictions where they spread invasively, including Iowa, Minnesota, and Texas.

Sunflower Plant and Care Guide
Yield:
Allow 2–4 plants per household member; large-flowered cultivars yield 1–2 lbs. (450–900 g) of dried seed per plant.
Planting:
Seed germinates in 10-14 days.
All Climates:  Plant seed or transplant seedlings in full sun in spring when soil warms to 65–85°F (18–29°C).

Damp, well-drained soil. Fertility: Rich. 5.8–6.2 pH. Prepare soil at least 18 in. (45 cm) deep.
Care:
Easy. Keep evenly damp; allow soil surface to dry between waterings. Fertilize monthly with acidic 5–10–10 formula or supplement with garden sulfur. Cultivate. Pest and disease resistant. Staggered rows of sunflowers provide shade, windbreaks for other plants.
Companions:
Beans, cucumbers, peas, Malabar spinach; use sunflowers as living stakes for pole and vining plants.
Harvest:
70–80 days. Harvest heads with mature seed loosely held in flower heads when plants’ stalks and leaves dry, cutting stalks 1 ft. (30 cm) below the flower and hanging heads upside down in a warm, sheltered, and dry spot for 4–6 weeks to completely dry the seed.
Storage Tips:
Remove seed from heads by shaking over a clean tarp. Fresh, stored a cool, dry spot, for 6 months; roasted, sealed in airtight bags, and frozen, 1 year. To roast seed, spread on a cookie sheet, bake at 250°F (120°C) for about 1 hour. Raw or roasted seed will also feed birds throughout the winter.

== Sweet Potatoes or Yams ==

Growing Sweet Potatoes or Yams
Sweet Potatoes and Garnet Yams are perennial warm-season tuberous vines of the Morning Glory family, while True or White Yams (Dioscorea alata) are unrelated tuberous, tropical, vining plants of the True Yam family.
Unrelated to potato, sweet potatoes are tender tropical plants, to 4 ft. (1.2 m) tall, that bear pink to purple flowers and develop brown, red, or tan tubers reminiscent of elongated potatoes with firm gold or yellow flesh with a sweet flavor.
Sweet potatoes and yams usually are prepared in the kitchen by baking, boiling, frying, steaming, or mashing.

Sweet Potato or Yam Plant and Care Guide

Harvest:
110–150 days. Harvest after 4 months, when test digging reveals fully developed potatoes, carefully digging with a garden fork, 24–30 in. (60–76 cm) from the stem, then gently pulling potatoes from central growth bud. Harvest promptly whenever vines wither or turn yellow, or upon frost.
Storage Tips:
For best fresh storage, cure in garden in direct sun for 3–4 hours, then place in a humid spot at 80–85°F (27–29°C) for 10–15 days after harvest. Fresh, stored in a dry, cool spot, 2–5 months. Eat sweet potatoes and yams baked, boiled, steamed, or mashed; they are rich in vitamin A and C.

== Swiss Chard ==

Growing Swiss Chard
Swiss chard is a cool-season, tender-perennial vegetable.
Closely related to beets, chard plants, 12–16 in. (30–40 cm) tall, are somewhat reminiscent of rhubarb and bear broad, curly, shiny, heavily veined leaves on attractive red or white stalks.
With New Zealand and Malabar spinach, chard is among the most heat-tolerant of leafy green vegetables. Both its greens and stalks are edible.
Because established Swiss Chard plants are also tolerant of cool weather, it is a good crop to plant in early autumn for harvests of stalks and greens through the beginning of hard frosts.

Swiss Chard Plant and Care Guide

Moist, well-drained, sandy loam. Fertility: Rich. 6.0–6.8 pH. Prepare soil at least 2 ft. (30 cm) deep.
Care:
Easy. Keep evenly moist; avoid wetting foliage. Fertilize every 4–6 weeks with 10–5–5 formula. Cultivate. Lodge or pinch flower stalk if plants begin to bolt. Aphid, lygus, springtail susceptible. Inspect frequently for foliage damage due to chewing and sap-sucking insect pests, root damage by boring pests.
Recognize and treat early any infections of Circospora leaf spot (Circospora beta cola) and Brown Spot (Rhizoctonia spp.), common fungal diseases of chard and beets.
Autumn–Winter Gardens:  Protect young plants in spring and maturing plants in autumn from chill, frost, and freezes.
Companions:
Chicory, garlic, leeks, mustard, onions.
Harvest:
45–55 days. Harvest beginning when plants are 6 in. (15 cm) tall, thinning outer leaves and leaving the central growth bud to resprout. In row plantings, harvest down the row over successive days; the first plants will recover as you reach the end of the row.
Storage Tips:
Fresh in vegetable keeper of refrigerator for 2–3 weeks; blanched, chilled, and frozen, 6 months. Eat chard greens fresh or steamed as for collards, spinach, and other greens; use diced chard stems to thicken and color soups and stews.

== Cherry, Grape, or Miniature Tomatoes ==

Growing Cherry and Miniature Tomatoes
Cherry and miniature tomatoes are warm-season, tender perennial, fruiting vegetables. They grow as bushy plants in sizes from dwarf or patio cultivars, 24 in. (60 cm) tall and wide, to full-sized varieties, 6 ft. (1.8 m) or more in diameter and height.
Smallest of the tomatoes at 3/4–1-1/2-in. (19–38 mm) in diameter, they make a perfect snack and salad food. They ripen in hues of gold, red, yellow, purple, black and even zebra-stripe green.
Many hybrid miniature tomatoes grow tall, single-stalk vines with trusses——handful-sized bunches—of fruit at intervals along the staked vine.

Cherry Tomato Plant and Care Guide

== Cooking, Saucing, and Paste Tomatoes ==

Growing Cooking Tomatoes
Cooking tomatoes are warm-season, tender fruiting perennial plants.
Most are oblong or pear shaped, with meatier flesh and sweeter flavor than eating varieties. These features make them ideal for tomato sauces and pastes.
While red is traditional, green, yellow and zebra-striped hybrids also are available for home gardeners, providing interesting options when plating recipes made with their sauces, pastes, salsas, and soups.
Many cultivars are determinate, ripening together and providing ample quantities at a single picking for preserving, sun-drying, canning, or freezing.

Cooking Tomato Plant and Care Guide
Yield:
Allow 3–6 plants of each cultivar, yielding 8–10 qts. (7.6–9.5 l).
Planting:

Inspect frequently for foliage damage or droppings due to tomato hornworm, a large, green moth larva, and other pests. Cooking cultivars are prone to blossom-end rot, a growth disorder; prevent it by planting resistant varietals or by watering regularly and dusting soil with crushed oyster shell, gypsum, and other high-calcium supplements.
Companions:
Asparagus, basil, borage, calendula, carrots, chamomile, chives, garlic, marigolds, onions, parsley, and shallots.
Harvest:
50–90 days. Determinate varieties: pick when full colored. Indeterminate varieties: pick when full colored, firm, and fragrant. Ripe tomatoes dimple when their skins are pressed by a fingernail. Support vines while gently removing fruit.
Storage Tips:
Fresh at 60–70°F (16–21°C) for 7–10 days; cut, packaged, and frozen, 3–4 months; canned, to 2 years; dried, to 1 year. Avoid refrigerating fresh tomatoes. Dry sliced tomatoes on drying trays or in a vegetable dehydrator. Freeze or use overripe fruit immediately for cooking; avoid canning due to loss of natural acids that increases hazard of botulism.

== Slicing or Eating Tomatoes ==

Growing Slicing or Eating Tomatoes
Slicing and eating tomatoes are warm-season, tender, fruiting perennial plants.
Largest, juiciest, and most flavorful of the many different types of tomatoes, eating tomatoes come in both early and midseason varieties; those with longer maturities have best taste and texture.
Indeterminate slicing tomatoes produce a series of ripening harvests in long-season regions, but need the entire season to ripen in short-season areas with late and early frosts. Determinate varieties ripen all at once, useful if the tomatoes will made into tomato juice.

Slicing or Eating Tomato Plant Guide
Yield:
Allow 1–2 plants of each cultivar per household member, mixing early and late cultivars. For juicing, allow 3–6 plants of each cultivar, yielding 5–8 qts. (4.7–7.6 l).
Planting:
Seed germinates in 8–10 days.
Tomato seed germination and early plant development vary with soil temperature. To start indoors, sow seed indoors 10–14 weeks before soil is expected to warm to 55°F (13°C) and harden tomato starts 7–10 days before transplanting.
Set out seedlings in full sun when soil warms to 55–85°F (13–29°C), or plant in late summer in hot climates, after heat has broken and 3 months of warm weather remains.
Allow 6–8 weeks for first flower set and tomato development. Sow 2–3 seeds in each drill 1/2-in. (12 mm) deep, 18 in. (45 cm) apart, thinning to 42 in. (1.1 m) apart.
Plant seedlings 42 in. (1.1 m) apart, in rows 40–50 in. (1–1.2 m) apart. For staking cultivars, thin to 24 in. (60 cm) apart, in rows 36–48 in. (90–120 cm) apart, installing stakes or cages at time of planting.
Conditions:
65–90°F (18–32°C). Flowers may fail to set fruit at temperatures over 85°F (29°C). Shade plants in full sunlight at temperatures over 90°F (32°C).
Soil:
Moist, well-drained soil. Fertility: Rich. 5.5–6.8 pH. Prepare soil at least 3 ft. (90 cm) deep.
Care:
Easy. Keep evenly moist during growth until flowers appear; avoid wetting foliage, fruit, or vines. Reduce watering after fruit set. Fertilize monthly with 5–10–10 formula until fruit begins to set; avoid high-nitrogen fertilizers. Mulch. Inspect frequently for foliage damage or droppings due to tomato hornworm, a large, green moth larva, and other pests. Blossom-end rot susceptible.
Companions:
Asparagus, basil, borage, calendula, carrots, chamomile, chives, garlic, marigolds, onions, parsley, and shallots.
Harvest:
50–90 days. Pick when full colored and desired size for eating; when green for frying, pickling. Ripe tomato dimples when a fingernail presses their skin. Support vines while gently removing fruit.
Storage Tips:
Fresh at 60–70°F (16–21°C), for 7–10 days; juiced and frozen, to 6 months; pickled, to 2 years. The tomato of choice for sandwiches, salads, and pizza, or picked green and pickled, or breaded and fried.

== Turnips ==

Growing Turnips
Turnips are cool-season root vegetables. Plants produce salad greens and edible, bulbous roots with white interiors with crisp textured flesh. Most are globe- or oval-shaped.
To grow turnips for greens, either harvest the plants’ leaves before roots form or choose greens-only cultivars.

Turnip Plant and Care Guide
Yield:
Allow 5–10 plants per household member.
Spacing:
Scatter seed and thin after true leaves develop to 4–6 in. (10–15 cm) apart.
Planting:
Seed germinates in 8–12 days.
Zones 3–7:  Sow seed in full sun–partial shade in late summer for early autumn harvest.
Zones 8–9: Sow seed in early spring for summer harvest when soil warms to 40–75°F (4–24°C), then again in early autumn for late autumn harvest.
Zones 10–11:  Sow seed in late autumn for winter harvest. Sow seed 1/2-in. (12-mm) deep, 1 in. (25 mm) apart, thinning to 4–6 in. (10–15 cm) apart, in rows 15–36 in. (38–90 cm) apart.
Autumn–Winter Gardens: Sow seed in July or August for harvest in Winter–Spring.
Plant successions every 3–4 weeks.
Conditions:
40–75°F (4–24°C). If temperatures exceed 75°F (24°C) for extended periods, roots will develop slowly and plants may fail.
Soil:
Moist, well-drained soil. Fertility: Rich. 5.5–6.8 pH. Prepare soil 1 ft. (30 cm) deep.
Care:
Easy. Keep evenly moist; avoid wetting foliage, fruit, or vines. Fertilize monthly with 5–10–10 formula. Mulch to avoid sunburn. Cultivate. Pest and disease resistant.
Companions:
Bush beans, peas, and southern peas.
Harvest:
30–60 days.
Greens:  Pick greens when 1 ft. (30 cm) long, thinning outer foliage and leaving the central growth bud to resprout.
Roots:  Harvest roots when 2–3 in. (50–75 mm) wide, digging carefully with a garden fork. Harvest promptly; leaving turnips in ground past maturity causes woody texture.
Storage Tips:
Fresh in vegetable keeper of refrigerator, 7–10 days for greens and 2–3 months for roots; cooked and frozen, 6 months. Immature roots store indefinitely in the ground at soil temperatures of 35–80°F (2–27°C); mulch heavily to insulate roots upon frost or when temperatures fall under 35°F (2°C). Turnip greens are generally rare in produce markets and prized for their delicate flavor, delicious if eaten raw in salads, or steamed. The turnip bulb, with its unique, sweet flavor, may be eaten raw, baked, or boiled and mashed.
